# Family Photo Album
This is a web based, family photo album.

As of December 2024, this project is just a concept.  The following needs to happen before this photo album
can be used:

- The web pages need to be designed.
- The underlying database (holding the photo metadata) needs to be designed and implemented.
- The code to build the web pages needs to be written.
- The above needs to be packaged for deployment.

This page will be updated as progress is made.

Some proof of concept work has aleady been done regarding face detection and face recognition.  This will be 
incorporated into the web page code.
