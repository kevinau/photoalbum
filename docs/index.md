# Photo album
This is a web based, family photo album.

## Basic design
This photo album is centred around textual searches--a bit like Google searches.  A search expression is entered 
at the top of the page, and all photos matching that search expression are displayed.

The search expression can include:
- Names of people included in the photos.
- When the photo was taken.
- Identified events that surround the time the photo was taken.
- Locations of where the photos were taken.
- Tags that identity certain aspects of the photos.

Groups of the above can also be specified and searched on.

Having textual searches allows for URL based searches.  See [search expression](/photoalbum/search-expression.html) for an
explanation of how search expressions are put together.
