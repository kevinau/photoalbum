# Search expressions

## Searching by person
Within the photos, people can be identified.  Say "Mary" and "Bob" are identified within the photos.


### Searching by a single person

If you search using:
  
  Mary
  
you will see all the photos that contain Mary.

### Searching for any two or more people

If you search using:

  Mary or Bob
  
you will see all the photos that contain Mary *or* Bob.  In general, a comma (as in "A,B") searches for A *or* B.

You can also use the word "or" in place of the comma (as in "A or B").

You can search for multiple people by adding more names separated by commas, followed by "or" an a name.  
For example, "A,B or C" will search for all photos that contain A, B or C.

### Searching for groups of people

If you search using:
  Mary and Bob

you will see all the photos that contain Mary *and* Bob (but not just Mary or just Bob).  In general, two terms separated by just spaces (as in "A B") searches for A *and* B.

You can also use the word "and" in place of the comma, as in "A and B".

You can search for multiple people by adding more names separated by commas, followed by "and" and a name.
For example, "A,B and C" will search for all photos that contain A, B and C.
